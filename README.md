# React Chat

A simple chat application built with React and a Ruby on Rails API.

Assignment for The Odin Project - [React Messaging App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-messaging-app)

## Disclaimer

You could say this project is deprecated - click [here](https://github.com/rejnowicz281/talk) to see the new version, built with React and Express. It's better in every way, and works in production (couldn't get this one to work with Fly.io).
